# WordPress Exporter Redux Extension
Plugin that demonstrates the hooks in [WordPress Exporter Redux][] that allow
plugins to extend an export.

## Description

For this plugin to do anything at all, you will need to install/activate [WordPress Exporter Redux][].

This plugin doesn't actually do anything useful.  It merely demonstrates how a plugin
can take advantage of the hooks provided in [WordPress Exporter Redux][] that are not in
the standard exporter.

## How can I help?

Have a comment/suggestion about the hooks in [WordPress Exporter Redux][] that this plugin demonstrations?
Head on over to [WordPress Exporter Redux: Issues][] and open an issue.

Have a comment about this plugin, per se?  I probably won't respond (after all, this is only a "demo")...but
if it is something really serious, then go ahead and open an issue here.
